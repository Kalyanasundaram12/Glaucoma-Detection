# Optic Disc Segmentation with a Deep Learning Model Using Fundus Images
The optic disc is a crucial structure in the eye where the optic nerve fibers exit the retina. It plays a significant role in many eye diseases, and its accurate segmentation from fundus images is essential for automated diagnosis systems.

In this project, we aim to leverage the power of Deep Learning to perform optic disc segmentation using fundus images. Fundus images are photographs of the interior surface of the eye and include structures such as the retina, optic disc, macula, and posterior pole (back of the eye). These images provide a wealth of information and are commonly used in diagnosing various eye diseases. Accurate segmentation of the optic disc from these images can aid in the diagnosis and treatment planning of these diseases.
